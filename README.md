# NYC Taxi Trip  

## Overview  
This web application provides an interactive way to explore New York City's 2014 Yellow Taxi Trip Data. Users can visualize trip routes on a map, analyze fare amounts based on trip distance and time, and interact with insightful charts derived from data aggregation. The application also includes dynamic filtering options to refine trip exploration.  

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://nyc-taxi-trips.vercel.app/

## Features  
- **Map Visualization:** Displays trip routes from pickup to drop-off using Mapbox GL JS.  
- **Fare Calculation:** Shows fare amounts based on trip time and distance.  
- **Data Insights:** Provides interactive charts using Recharts to visualize aggregated data.  
- **Filtering Options:** Allows users to filter trips by time, fare amount, trip distance, and payment type.  
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Uses React Query for optimized data fetching and caching.  

## Tech Stack  
### **Frontend**  
- **React.js & Next.js** – SPA with server-side rendering capabilities.  
- **Mapbox GL JS** – For interactive map visualization.  
- **Recharts** – To generate insightful data visualizations.  
- **React Query** – Efficient data fetching and caching.  
- **CSS & Tailwind CSS** – For a responsive and user-friendly design.  

### **Backend**  
- **Next.js API Routes** – For fetching and filtering taxi trip data.  
- **Socrata API** – Utilized as a data source to handle large datasets efficiently.  

### **Optional Database**  
- **PostgreSQL & PostGIS** – Can be used for managing spatial queries efficiently.  

## Installation  
### **Prerequisites**  
- Node.js v16+ installed  
- Mapbox API key (if using Mapbox for maps)
